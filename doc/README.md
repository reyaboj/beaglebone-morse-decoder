Morse Code Decoder
---------------------
This project is an implementation of a Morse code decoder running on the Beaglebone Black. It uses JohnnyFive to read signals from a passive-infrared motion sensor (PIR sensor) and decode them using the Morse code encoding. The architecture used is a simple client-server setup where thin clients receive the decoded message from the server. Google's Firebase is used to allow clients to be notified of the message as it is processed by the server.
